# TikTok-Analytics-with-streamlit
<p> This project was carried out by following <a href= 'https://github.com/nicknochnack/TikTokAnalytics'> Nick Nochnak's </a> tutorial. </p>
<p> This project entails displaying some tiktok data based on the desired hashtag searched for. </p>
<p> During the course of carrying out this project, I was able to; </p>
<ol> <li> Obtain real time data from tiktok </li>
  <li> Clean and preprocess the data using ETL pipeline </li>
  <li> Using plotly visualizations to create several streamlit dashboards for easier understanding of the obtained data </li> </ol>
